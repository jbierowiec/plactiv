## An application that helps you visualize, prepare for, and advise on your planned itineraries. The application currently allows users to do two things: 1. to determine the elevation of any uploaded `.gpx` file, produces a `.csv` file with information about the calculated elevation gain, loss, grade as well as segment difficulty level. 2. To create a video, tracing out the planned route, and providing the total mileage, expected speed, and elevation along the route from a simulated itinerary.
